ntop is a tool that shows the network usage, similar to what the
popular top Unix command does. ntop is based on pcapture
(ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pcapture.tar.Z) and it has been written in
a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform.

ntop can be used in both interactive or web mode. In the first case,
ntop displays the network status on the user's terminal whereas in
web mode a web browser (e.g. netscape) can attach to ntop (that acts
as a web server) and get a dump of the network status. In the latter
case, ntop can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with an embedded
web interface.

ntop uses libpcap, a system-independent interface for user-level
packet capture.  Before building ntop, you must first retrieve and
build libpcap, from ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z

Once libpcap is built (either install it or make sure it's in
../libpcap), you can build ntop using the procedure in the INSTALL
file.

ntop is distributed under the GNU GPL (see the COPYING file).

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to the email address
"ntop@ntop.org".
