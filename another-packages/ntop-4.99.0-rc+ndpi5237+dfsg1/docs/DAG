How to use a DAG card with ntop
-------------------------------

Why DAG?
========
DAG is a very fast and efficient card used for capturing traffic
at very high speeds. If you have a fast (Gbit and above) network
then this is probably the very best solution you can find on
the market.

How to use ntop on DAG
======================
1. Get a DAG card from Endace (www.endace.com)
2. Get the DAG toolkit from Endace and install it (e.g. on /usr/local/dag)
3. Get lipcap 0.81 or newer from www.tcpdump.org
4. cd libcap-XXXX
   ./configure --with-dag=/usr/local/dag
   make
   make install [as root]
5. Get the ntop source (see http://www.ntop.org/download.html)
   from CVS
6. Compile ntop as usual but do make sure that ntop
   uses the libpcap you've just compiled.

Many thanks to Endace for having donated a DAG card to
the ntop project for the purpose of integrating it with
ntop.
