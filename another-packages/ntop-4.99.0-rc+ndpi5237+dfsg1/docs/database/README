NTOP DATABASE SUPPORT
---------------------

ntop allows network traffic information to be stored in a MySQL database for further processing. This applies *only* to NetFlow flows. 

Supposing that you compiled ntop with mysql support, you can configure flow DB export via ntop: plugins->netflow plugin -> configure


Have fun!
