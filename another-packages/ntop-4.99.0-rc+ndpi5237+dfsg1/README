See files in docs/ for more info.


For instructions on how to build ntop from source, see docs/BUILD-NTOP.txt (*nix).

The file docs/BUILD-MinGW.txt (Win32) may assist you in building ntop under MinGW,
but this configuration is not officially supported.  The prebuilt executable
distributed - for a convenience fee - through http://shop.ntop.org is built with
Microsoft's Visual C++ .Net compiler.

For instructions on how to run ntop the 1st time, see docs/1STRUN.txt.

Online information is at http://www.ntop.org.

Archives of the ntop mailings lists are at http://listgateway.unipi.it/pipermail/ntop/
and http://listgateway.unipi.it/pipermail/ntop-dev/ and are also searchable through
Google (use site:listgateway.unipi.it ntop <your keywords>.

Contributions of effort towards writing, rewriting and updating ntop's documentation would 
be heartily welcomed!
