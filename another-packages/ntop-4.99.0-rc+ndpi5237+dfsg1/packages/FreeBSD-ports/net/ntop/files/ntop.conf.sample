#  This file, ntop.conf.sample is a sample of an ntop configuration file.     #
#                                                                             #
#  You should copy this file to it's normal location, /etc/ntop.conf          #
#  and edit it to fit your needs.                                             #
#                                                                             #
#       ntop is easily launched with options by referencing this file from    #
#       a command line like this:                                             #
#                                                                             #
#       ntop @/etc/ntop.conf                                                  #
#                                                                             #
#  Remember, options may also be listed directly on the command line, both    #
#  before and  after the @/etc/ntop.conf.                                     #
#                                                                             #
#  For switches that provide values, e.g. -i, the last one matters.           #
#  For switches just say 'do things', e..g -M, if it's ANYWHERE in the        #
#  commands, it will be set.  There's no unset option.                        #
#                                                                             #
#  You can use this to your advantage, for example:                           #
#       ntop @/etc/ntop.conf -i none                                          #
#  Overrides the -i in the file.                                              #
#                                                                             #
