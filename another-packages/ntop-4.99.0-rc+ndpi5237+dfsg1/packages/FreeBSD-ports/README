This directory contains the files for the FreeBSD ntop ports.
Normally the entire contents would be a .tgz, e.g:

tar cfvz ntop-3.0pre2.tgz net/ntop/

These are the 3.0pre2 files - they are pretty close to the 3.0 version, except:

1. (obviously) not the final source (net/ntop/distinfo will need update)
2. The patch in packages/FreeBSD-ports/net/ntop/files/patch-configure-in and 
   packages/FreeBSD-ports/net/ntop/files/patch-configure which allows libtool 1.3.5
   in addition to 1.3.4, is in the ntop cvs post 3.0pre2 and will need to be removed.
3. Really ought to figure out the patch in net/ntop/files/patch-ntop-h and get it into
   the baseline.
