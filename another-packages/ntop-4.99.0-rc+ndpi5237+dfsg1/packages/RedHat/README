This directory contains the raw files (except for the ones copied
from the normal cvs such as 1STRUN.txt) used to build the rpms
posted at SourceForge.




For reference the rpms are normally built on tigger, which is
a RedHat 9 machine, using the buildmeister userid.

tigger is kept pretty much upto date on various packages.

For 3.1 these were built on a VirtualPC2004 machine (Zebra not Tigger).
