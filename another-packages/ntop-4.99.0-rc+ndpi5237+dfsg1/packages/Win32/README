This directory contains a project for building ntop for Win32.
In order to use it you need:
1. the ntop source (you've got obviously)
2. gdbm/gd/libpng/zlib sources that you can find on the Internet

You will probably need to change the file paths according to your setup.

NOTE: this project file is totally unsupported.
