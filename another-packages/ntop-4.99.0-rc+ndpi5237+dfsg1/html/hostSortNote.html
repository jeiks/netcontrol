<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hosts</h3>
<p>The 'hosts' column is actually a composite of many items of information tracked and 
discovered by <b>ntop</b> for display.  This field contains the best information we have 
as to the <i>name</i> of a host, be that a DNS resolved name, an IP address, a 
MAC address or something else.</p>
<p>Because it is a composite, a simple alphanumeric sort (0, 1, 2, 3 ... a, b, c ...) 
is not used. It is perfectly normal, and correct, to see - as in the example above - a 
host 'name' beginning with "w", such as www.burtonstrauss.com followed by one beginning 
'3COM', which is normally earlier in an alphanumeric sort. The first level of sorting is 
by the type of the item and the second is alphanumeric (or numerical or whatever
makes sense) within types.</p>
<p>This means - for example within an ascending sort - that all DNS names will be in 
alphabetical order. Following the DNS names comes IP addresses (sorted in numerical 
order so that 10.0.0.0 follows 9.255.255.255).
After IP addresses come other types of items in sequences appropriate to their types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual value displayed in the hosts column may be further processed as part of 
creating the actual html link. These affect the displayed value, but NOT the sort sequence.</p>
<p>The most visible of these changes is that all MAC addresses are NOT sorted as their native
48-bit quantities.  There are cases where <b>ntop</b> recognizes a special MAC code (such 
as Spanning Tree Bridge) or recognizes the vendor code from the 
<a href="http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml" title="Off-site link to IEEE OUI download/query page">IEEE OUI</a>
(Organizational Unique Identifier) list and adjusts the displayed information.
These adjusted names will appear followed by the last 24 (unique) bits, e.g. as 3COM 
CORPORATION:ff:ff:ff, and are sorted without regard to upper and lower case, so that all 
of a vendors assigned ranges of network cards should be sorted together.  In reality, the
IEEE list often has multiple forms of the vendors name, and so there will not be a perfect
sort.
Unrecognized prefixes will be sorted after recognized ranges according to a numeric compare
of their 48-bit values.
Note that if the actual 48-bit value not displayed, it is visible as a tooltip (title)
by hovering the mouse over the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible for items to be listed (and thus sorted, before <b>ntop</b> has come
to a final decision about the 'name'. These items are sorted last, based on the underlying 
fields <b>ntop</b> maintains about each host. This can look 'odd' - wait a minute or so and 
resort - things should clear up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Domain</h3>
<p>A similar situation applies to sorting the 'Domain' column.  This column is sorted
in alphabetic sequence of the two character 
<a href="http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/">ISO 3166</a>
code (e.g. US for United States, CA for
Canada, DE for Germany), followed by <i>local</i> entries.
<p>A flag value of <i>local</i> shows that the IP address is part of the 
RFC 1918 
(<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html</a>)
"Address Allocation for Private Internets") address ranges, 10.0.0.0/8, 176.16.0.0/16 and 
192.168.0.0/16.
These are typically addresses assigned by a LAN, corporate or ISP's DHCP server to enable 
NAT (Network Address Translation, as defined by 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1631.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1631.html</a>).</p>
<p>Domains which are equal are sorted - as fall-backs - by 1) the full domain name (i.e. stripped of the 1st 
qualified) and then 2) the host value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fall-back criteria are also not immediately set, and so the domain column
sort may be 'odd' in appearance until the data stabilizes.  You have seen this effect if you have 
noticed that at first domain entries seem out of sequence and that it may take
a while for the flags to appear in the column.  This is annoying but perfectly normal.</p><h3>But the flag data is wrong!!!!</h3>
<p>You will notice that there may not be much correlation between the last qualifiers 
(e.g. .com or .co.uk) and the country flag shown.  This is because <b>ntop</b> uses
data from  various sources to map an IP address such as 141.113.96.150 to it's physical location.
And, frankly, their data isn't very good.</p>
<p>The primary source are the regional number registries:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>APNIC, <i>Asia Pacific Network Information Centre</i> at http://www.apnic.net</li>
		<li>ARIN, <i>American Registry for Internet Numbers</i> at http://www.arin.net</li>
		<li>LACNIC, <i>Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry</i> at http://www..net</li>
		<li>RIPE, <i>R&eacute;seaux IP Europ&eacute;ens</i> at http://www..net</li>
	</ul>
<p>We also include Tier 1 registry data from Cable &amp; Wireless - because the registry data 
at the regional registries is so messed up.  Similar data might be available for other Tier 1 
ISPs - tracking down the files is the hard part - start the search at 
http://www.irr.net/docs/list.html and/or RADB - ftp.radb.net.</p>
<p>Still - this data is often wrong or incomplete.  Perhaps more frequently, a web site is 
hosted somewhere different than you might think or is distributed
around the world (and you are seeing a local mirror) or is part of a private block, where
the subdivisions are simply not known.</p>
<p>For example, Ford.com makes sense tagged as "US" since that's where Ford's headquarters is 
located.  However ford.co.uk, also "US", seems odd.
If one looks up the ip address, you find that the entire block is assigned to Ford Motor Company
with a US address:

# ARIN WHOIS database, last updated 2004-02-27 19:15
# Enter ? for additional hints on searching ARIN's WHOIS database.</pre>
If you then look in <b>ntop</b>'s p2c table, you find:
<pre>US:136.1.0.0/16</pre>
Mystery solved.  ARIN allocated the block to a US company, so that's what ARIN
lists the allocation as.</p>
<p>Could <b>ntop</b> do better - yes, but only with knowledge of the 
(non-public) internal division of Ford's address block. If you have that knowledge
and it is important to you, then create a private p2c table.  If you do a</p>
<pre>make p2ctable</pre>
<p>in the <b>ntop</b> source directory, you invoke the <i>utils/p2c</i> script, which
downloads the raw data from the registries and builds a new p2c file.  It also has
the capability for adding 'manual' override information via files named manual.something.
For example, if you created a file manual.ford:</p>
<pre>ford|UK|ipv4|136.8.154.0|256|</pre>
<p>and rebuild the p2c file, that breakdown of Ford's range would now be reflected in
the country flags.</p>
<p>The manual file format is</p>
<pre><i>name|countrycode|ipv4|address|number of addresses</i></pre>
<p>Where 
<i>name</i> can be anything you want, 
<i>countrycode</i> must be 1, 2 or 3 characters and 
is used to create the IMG tag for the flag shown, i.e. xxx.gif,
<i>ipv4</i> is the constant 'ipv4', 
<i>address</i> is a numeric IP address
and 
<i>number of addresses</i> is, well, the number of sequential addresses this
applies to.
Thus the line says that addresses from 136.8.154.0 - 136.8.154.255 are located in
the UK.  Check the rebuilt table and there it is:</p>
<pre>US:136.4.0.0/14
US:136.8.0.0/13
UK:136.8.154.0/24
US:136.16.0.0/12
US:136.32.0.0/11</pre>
<p>Is that correct?  Who knows.  But it's a good example.</p>
<p>Another 'clever' thing you could do is to override ARIN's data with these lines:</p>
<pre>ford|FMK|ipv4|136.1.0.0|9175040|
ford|FMC|ipv4|136.8.154.0|256|</pre>

(9175040 represents 140 * 256 * 256 which is the size of the Ford block)</p>
<p>Now if you create fmc.gif and fmk.gif - perhaps the Ford and Ford/UK flags, those are what
will show up under 'domain'.</p><h3>Tiny flags</h3>
<p>There are plenty of sets of better/larger/more detailed flags.  As long as they're named according
to the ISO 3166 code (e.g. us.gif for USA), <b>ntop</b> will find and use them in the html/statsicons/
directory.  See the note in docs/FAQ for a couple of available sets.</p>
