<h1><b>ntop</b> Privacy Notices</h1>
<h2>End Users</h2>
<p>If you have concerns about your privacy, please read this notice.</p>
<p>After reading it, <i>if you have any concerns about your privacy while using any 
networked system please contact your systems administrator(s) to discuss your concerns.</i></p>
<p>If you are seeing this notice, it is likely that the <b>ntop</b> program is being 
used by your systems administrators to monitor network usage and that the information
collected by <b>ntop</b> is available to end users.</p>
<p>Please be aware that all <b>ntop</b> does is to examine the contents of 
the information flowing over the networks to which it is connected. <b>ntop</b>
has no special privileges - this information is available to ANY similarly 
connected network user.</p>
<p>The information collected by <b>ntop</b> does contain individually identifiable
information, that is information about your individual usage of this computer network.
For example, this information will indicate the sites your computer has contacted,
the protocol used (e.g. http or ftp), the amount of information transferred and the
duration of each contact.
All of this is derived from the header which is a part of 
each chunk of information (called a packet) transmitted or received over the network.
<i>This header information is similar to the destination and return address on a postal
card - it's visible to anyone who happens to see the card.</i></p>
<p>In addition, some information within the packets is also examined and reported.
This will indicate, for example, the user names used to contact mail servers, P2P
networks, etc. 
This information is also available to ANY computer on the network with the same
connections as the <b>ntop</b> host.  It is just not normally viewed.
<i>Thus you should expect information transmitted over a computer network to be
similar to a postal card - visible to anyone who happens to look over it.</i> If this
is a concern for you, you should discuss appropriate security measures, such as 
encryption and Virtual Private Networks with your systems administrator(s).</p>
<p>The information collected by <b>ntop</b> may, or may not, be made available to end 
users - this is entirely at the discretion of the systems administrator(s).  If it is
made available, then the information discussed above is available to other individuals.
If this is a privacy concern for you, please contact your systems administrator(s).
The authors of <b>ntop</b> do not have any control nor special influence over 
the administrator(s) of your local system. Please do not contact the authors of 
<b>ntop</b> regarding your individual privacy concerns.</p>
<p>For more information about <b>ntop</b>, please ask your systems 
administrator(s) or visit <a href="http://www.ntop.org" title="www.ntop.org">www.ntop.org</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Systems Administrators</h2>
<p><i>An abbreviated version of this privacy notice is printed by <b>ntop</b>
in the system log (or directed to the executing users' terminal) during the 
very first run of <b>ntop</b>.</i>
An authorized user may click
<a href="privacyFlagForce.html">here</a>
to force <b>ntop</b> to report the privacy notice at the beginning of EVERY
future run.  Or you may click
<a href="privacyFlagClear.html">here</a>
to have <b>ntop</b> re-issue the privacy notice at the beginning of the next 
<b>ntop</b> run and then stop issuing it for future runs.
</p>
<hr width="200" align="center">
<p>By default at startup and at periodic intervals, the <b>ntop</b> program will
retrieve a file containing current <b>ntop</b> program version information.
Retrieving this file allows this <b>ntop</b> instance to confirm that it is
running the most current version.</p>
<p>The retrieval is done using standard http:// requests, which will create
log records on the hosting system. These log records do contain
information which identifies a specific <b>ntop</b> site. Accordingly, you
are being notified that this individually identifiable information is
being transmitted and recorded.</p>
<p>You may request - via the <i>--skip-version-check</i> run-time option - that
this check be eliminated. If you use this option, no individually
identifiable information is transmitted or recorded, because the entire
retrieval and check is skipped.</p>
<p>We ask you to allow this retrieval and check, because it benefits both
you and the <b>ntop</b> developers. It benefits you because you will be 
automatically notified if the <b>ntop</b> program version is obsolete, becomes
unsupported or is no longer current. It benefits the developers of
<b>ntop</b> because it allows us to determine the number of active <b>ntop</b>
instances, and the operating system/versions that users are running
<b>ntop</b> under. This allows us to focus development resources on systems
like those our users are using <b>ntop</b> on.</p>
<p>The individually identifiable information is contained in the web
server log records which are automatically created each time the version
file is retrieved. This is a function of the web server and not
of <b>ntop</b>, but we do take advantage of it. The log record shows the IP
address of the requestor (the <b>ntop</b> instance) and a User-Agent header
field. We place information in the User-Agent header as follows:
</p>
<pre>
 ntop/&lt;version&gt;
 host/&lt;name from config.guess&gt;
 distro/&lt;if one&gt;
 release/&lt;of the distro, also if one&gt;
 kernrlse/&lt;kernel version or release&gt;
 GCC/&lt;version&gt;
 config() -&nbsp;condensed parameters from ./configure&
 run() -&nbsp;condensed flags - no data - from the execution line
 libpcap/&lt;version&gt;
 gdbm/&lt;version&gt;
 openssl/&lt;version&gt;
 zlib/&lt;version&gt;
 access/&lt;http, https, both or none&gt;
 interfaces() &lt;given interface names&gt;
 uptime() &lt;seconds this instance has been active&gt;
</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
 ntop/2.2.98 host/i686-pc-linux-gnu distro/redhat release/9 kernrlse/2.4.20-8smp
 GCC/3.2.2 config(i18n) run(i; u; P; w; t; logextra; m; instantsessionpurge;
 schedyield; d; usesyslog=; t) gdbm/1.8.0 openssl/0.9.7a zlib/1.1.4
 access/http interfaces(eth0,eth1)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Distro and release information is determined at compile time and consists
of information typically found in the /etc/release (or similar) file. See the 
<b>ntop</b> tool linuxrelease for how this is determined.</li>
<li>gcc compiler version (if available) is the internal version #s for the
gcc compiler, e.g. 3.2.3.</li>
<li>kernrlse is the Linux Kernel version or the xBSD release such as
4.9-RELEASE and is determined from the uname data (if it's available).</li>
<li>The ./configure parameters are stripped of directory paths, leading -s,
etc. to create a short form that shows us what ./configure parameters
people are using.</li>
<li>Similarly, the run time parameters are stripped of data and paths, just
showing which flags are being used.</li>
<li>The libpcap, gdbm, openssl and zlib versions come from the strings
returned by the various inquiry functions (if they're available).</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTES: This report is prepared by sorting and compressing 
requests using the unblinded ip address. Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjacent lines that are completely identical are 
indicative of multiple requests from different machines in 
the same /16 block.</li>
<li>Adjacent lines that have the same /16 address but are 
otherwise different may be different machines or may be 
from the same machine running multiple OSes/versions</li>
