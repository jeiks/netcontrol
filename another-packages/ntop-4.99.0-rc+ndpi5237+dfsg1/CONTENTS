What's in the ntop distribution ?
---------------------------------

1) ntop                 [. directory]
All of the source for ntop is in this, root, directory of the distribution.

2) rrd                  [myrrd/ directory]
This is a frozen (stable) version of rrdtool which ntop statically links to.

3) configureextra
OS and distribution/release specific extensions for ./configure

4) plugins
ntop add ons, such as sflow, pda, etc.

5)  html
html files used by ntop, includes images

6) docs
All the documentation that's fit to print! Please help us out and write more!

7) utils
Little pieces of code that might be useful or are used in the preparation
of data files and such.

8) www
How to extract data out of ntop using Perl/PHP/Python

9) packages
Files used to build executable packages for MacOSX, RedHat and Suse environments.
More a starting point than a finished output, due to tool differences, file layouts,
etc.

   NOTE: The 'RedHat' files are older and NOT the ones used to create the
         .rpm files posted at SourceForge.

10) installer
Files used to build executable packages for MacOSX.

11) NetFlow
(Old) A simple NetFlow collector that stores in a MySQL DB all the traffic information 
sent by a NetFlow probe such as ntop.




Have fun!
