addMacAddress
-------------

Allows you to add a twin MAC Address/Symbolic host name to
the ntop.db file. ntop will then use the specified symbolic
name instead of the MAC Address.

This utility can be used by those people that run ntop
on a network containing some non-IP hosts. 

NOTES:
1) ntop.db is owned by root -> make sure to run the
   above tool as root or change the ntop.db permissions
   [strongly not suggested]
2) you CANNOT run the above tool while ntop is running
   because the ntop.db file is locked exclusively by ntop


addMacAddressFile.pl
--------------------

Perl script that reads the specified file and calls 
addMacAddress for each file entry. The file format is
the following:

MAC Address	Symbolic host name
             ^                      ^
             |                      |
            Tab                  return
