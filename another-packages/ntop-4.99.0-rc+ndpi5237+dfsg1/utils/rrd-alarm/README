About this tool
---------------

rrd_alarm is a tool that allows you to generate alarms based on some values stored into RRD files.

You can use it as an ntop companion:
- start ntop
- configure the ntop RRD plugin so that you can generate RRD files for the hosts/interfaces you're monitoring
- configure rrd_alarm so that you can monitor some of these RRD files and generate alarms based on thresholds
