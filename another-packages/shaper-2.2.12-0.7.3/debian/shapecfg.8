.SH NAME
shapecfg \- Traffic Shaper for Linux
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shapecfg attach
.I "shaper-device other-device"
.br
.B shapecfg speed
.I "device speed"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shapecfg
is a program to limit bandwidth on a virtual network interface.
.SH SETUP
A shaper device is configured using the shapecfg program.
Typically you will do something like this:

shapecfg attach shaper0 eth1

shapecfg speed shaper0 64000

ifconfig shaper0 myhost netmask 255.255.255.240 broadcast 1.2.3.255 up

route add -net some.network netmask a.b.c.d dev shaper0

The shaper should have the same IP address as the device it is attached to
for normal use.
.SH GOTCHAS
The shaper shapes transmitted traffic. It's rather impossible to shape
received traffic except at the end (or a router) transmitting it.

Gated/routed/rwhod/mrouted all see the shaper as an additional device and
will treat it as such unless patched. Note that for mrouted you can run
mrouted tunnels via a traffic shaper to control bandwidth usage.

The shaper is device/route based. This makes it very easy to use with any
setup BUT less flexible. You may well want to combine this patch with Mike
McLagan <mmclagan@linux.org>'s patch to allow routes to be specified by
source/destination pairs.

There is no "borrowing" or "sharing" scheme. This is a simple traffic
limiter. I'd like to implement Van Jacobson and Sally Floyd's CBQ
architecture into Linux one day (maybe in 2.1 sometime) and do this with
style.

(CBQ was added to Linux in the 2.1 series. On Debian systems, see the
iproute package for the necessary userspace tools. Support for the simple
traffic shaper is still present as of 2.4, and, while it is less flexible,
most people will probably find it easier to set up.)
