"In order to use the programs in this package, you need the shaper, sch_cbq, "
"sch_tbf, sch_sfq, sch_prio, cls_fw, cls_u32, and cls_route kernel modules. "
"Some of these (${missing}) can't be seen on your system currently. There are "
"several possibilities. You may have compiled them into your kernel "
"statically (as opposed to building them as modules), in which case you may "
"discard this message. If, however, they aren't available at all (either as "
"modules or as compiled-in drivers), you will need to either recompile your "
"kernel or use a different kernel-image package. Please read /usr/share/doc/"
"shaper/README.Debian for more details."
