shaper (2.2.12-0.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/init.d/shaper (cbq.init): Change 'exit 1' to 'exit 0' for the case

shaper (2.2.12-0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source for cbq.init (closes: #150655). Forward-ported my
    patches.

shaper (2.2.12-0.6.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Dec 2001 19:53:56 +0000

shaper (2.2.12-0.6.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

shaper (2.2.12-0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Aargh, my work machine showed me the kernel-modules note twice. I should
    just know to be careful with seen ... what I really want to know is "has
    the question been asked since upgrading to at least 2.2.12-0.6.2-1?". So
    implement that with FGET and FSET.
  * Remove debian/conffiles, as I'm using debhelper 3 and so had duplicates.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jun 2001 12:00:20 +0100

shaper (2.2.12-0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source for cbq.init (closes: #101310, #101311). The package
    versioning now includes the init script's version number.
  * Reapply my patches manually, removing some unnecessary ones.
  * README.cbq is now automatically generated from the comments at the top
    of the init script.
  * Add tcio7.ps.gz from the cbq.init FTP site.
  * sch_sfq and sch_prio are now needed as well. Update README.Debian and
    the debconf question shaper/kernel-modules, and force the question to be
    asked again when upgrading from earlier than this version.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jun 2001 22:48:37 +0100

shaper (2.2.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

shaper (2.2.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload sponsored by Tony Mancill, as with 2.2.12-1.
  * modprobe writes errors to stderr (duh), not stdout. Quieten that warning
    and clean up another about /etc/shaper not being configured - a debconf
    interface to that should follow eventually. Also add a debconf note if
    the required modules aren't available (closes: #81327).
  * modutils isn't an essential package, just Priority: required. Add a test
    for modprobe's existence to the init script.
  * Depend on debconf.

shaper (2.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #80929).
  * New upstream source from Red Hat 7.0 (manufactured .orig.tar.gz from
    .src.rpm).
  * Standards-Version: 3.2.1:
    - Converted to debhelper, getting FHS updates for free.
    - Build dependencies.
    - Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Added pointer to GPL.
    - Updated download information.
  * Fixed errors in man page (closes: #52713, #69932).
  * Use upstream's new init script for setting up CBQ (class-based queueing)
    traffic shaping according to configuration files in /etc/shaper.
    Modified it somewhat for Debian policy and to allow the relevant bits of
    the kernel to be non-modular.
  * Added crontab entry to allow time-dependent rules in the above.
  * Depend on iproute for CBQ userspace tools. Since iproute is extra,
    downgraded shaper to extra to match.
  * Updated debian/control and README.Debian.
