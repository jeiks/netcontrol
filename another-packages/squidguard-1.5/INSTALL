  Installing SquidGuard

    1. Unpack the source

 tar xvzf squidGuard-1.2.0.tar.gz

    2. Compiling
       Let's assume it is squidGuard-1.2.0 we are trying to install:

 cd squidGuard-1.2.0
 ./configure
 make

       If no errors occurred squidGuard is now installed in /usr/local/.
       There are a couple of option you can use when running .configure.
       For example:

   Installing in a different location
 ./configure --prefix=/some/other/directory

   BerkeleyDB not in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB installed
 ./configure  --with-db=/directory/of/BerkeleyDB/installation

       Annotation: Make sure that the shared library of your BerkeleyDB
       installation is known by your system (check /etc/ld.so.conf).

   See all .configure options
 ./configure --help

    3. Installing

 su -
 make install

    4. Installing the blacklists
       Copy your blacklists into the desired blacklist directory (default:
       /usr/local/squidGuard/db) and unpack them. In the table below we
       assume that the default location is used. Make sure that you have
       the proper permissions to write to that directory.

 cp /path/to/your/blacklist.tar.gz /usr/local/squidGuard/db
 cd /usr/local/squidGuard/db
 gzip -d blacklist.tar.gz
 tar xfv blacklist.tar

       Now the blacklists should be ready to use.

   Congratulation. You have just completed the installation of squidGuard.
   The next step is to configure the software according to your needs.
   First start configuring SquidGuard. After you verified that SquidGuard
   is working fine, make the required modification to your Squid by adding
   the following line:

 redirect_program /usr/local/bin/squidGuard -c /usr/local/squidGuard/squidGuard.
conf

   The other way round will make you unhappy.
