   squidGuard - 1.4 Features

   With version 1.4 there have been several changes and bug fixes:
   New Features:
     * Added mysql support for authentication based on a patch from Chris
       Fletcher (thank you). Tested with MySQL 5.0. (bug 19)
     * Added a runtime option to switch the progress bar and off.
       The default behaviour of squidGuard has been switch back to showing
       no progress bar. To switch on the progress bar use the runtime
       option -b.
     * Added a runtime option to prevent squidGuard from falling into
       emergeny mode when something with the update of the blacklists goes
       wrong (patch by Chris Pates and Iain Fothegill of the CLEO Systems
       at Lancaster University, thank you). If you use the runtime option
       -P and the creation of the db files fail, squidGuard simply writes
       an error message but continues. Make sure to test this option
       before using it in production environments.
     * Rewrite of the sample script squidGuard.cgi. The language related
       part has been exported to babel files (one for each language) and
       the layout has been modified in a way that it is a bit more nice to
       the eyes and easier to change.
       If you are going to use the new script make sure to either copy the
       babel files into your script directory or change the location of
       the babel files within squidGuard.cgi.
     * Stopped downloading the documentation from www.squidguard.org. The
       docs are now updated with the package not by "calling home".
     *
     * Added Spanish translation to squidGuard.cgi (thank you, Samuel
       García for the translation). (bug 26).

   Changes to configure options:
     * NEW: --with-mysql
       Use MySQL support. Configure will look in /usr and /usr/local for
       the installation of MySQL.
     * CHANGED: --with-nolog=yes
       This replaces the old configure option "--nolog".
     * CHANGED: --with-squiduser=<username>
       This replaces the old configure option "-u=<username>" and
       "--squiduser=<username>", respectively.

   Bug Fixes:
     * Reduced "noise" of progress bar.
     * Moved output of the progress bar from stdout to stderr since squid
       was complaining about this "input". (bug 39)
     * Fixed an issue with redirect statements that use a "~" in the url.
       (bug 23)
     * Fixed an issue with squidGuard craching when urls ended in "://".
       (bug40)
     * Fixed issue with perl warnings about deprecated usage of hash
       syntax by rewriting squidGuard.cgi as stated above. (bug 37)
     * Fixed the bypass vulnerability with trailing dots in domain names.
       This only affects squidGuard when used with squid version 3. (bug
       38)
     * Fixed issue that on some systems y.tab.c and y.tab.h were not
       properly created although bison was installed. Updated the prepared
       files as well. (bug 34)
     * Fixed an issue with a forgotten check for the existance of the
       configuration directory: The "make install" command now tests if
       the directory of the configuration file exists. If it does not
       exist, the directory is created. (bug 35)
     * Fixed an issue that the prepared flex file was not copied when flex
       is not installed. Now, if no flex/lex is found during the configure
       run, "make" checks again and copies the prepared file now fine.
       (bug 31)
     * Fixed configure.in to give the proper configure file when running
       autoconf. As a result the syntax of a couple of configure options
       had to be changed (see above).
     * Fixed broken "make test". (bug 17)
