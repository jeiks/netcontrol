  Basic Configuration of SquidGuard

   Once SquidGuard is successfully installed, you want to configure the
   software according to your needs. A sample configuration has been
   installed in the default directory  /usr/local/squidGuard (or whatever
   directory you pointed you intallation to).
   Below you find three examples for the basic configuration of
   SquidGuard.
    1. Most simple configuration

       Most simple configuration: one category, one rule for all
#
# CONFIG FILE FOR SQUIDGUARD
#

dbhome /usr/local/squidGuard/db
logdir /usr/local/squidGuard/logs

dest porn {
        domainlist porn/domains
        urllist porn/urls
        }

acl {
        default {
                pass !porn all
                redirect http://localhost/block.html
        }
 }

       Make always sure that the very first line of your squidGuard.conf
       is not empty!
       The entries have the following meaning:

   dbhome Location of the blacklists
   logdir Location of the logfiles
   dest Definition of a category to block. You can enter the domain and
   url file along with a regular expression list (talk about regular
   expressions later on).
   acl The actual blocking defintion. In our example only the default is
   displayed. You can have more than one acl in place. The category porn
   you defined in dest is blocked by the expression !porn. You have to add
   the identifier all after the blocklist or your users will not be able
   to surf anyway.
   The redirect directive is madatory! You must tell SquidGuard which page
   to display instead of the blocked one.
    2. Choosing more than one category to block
       First you define your categories. Just like you did above for porn.
       For example:

       Defining three categories for blocking
dest adv {
        domainlist      adv/domains
        urllist         adv/urls
}
dest porn {
        domainlist      porn/domains
        urllist         porn/urls
}
dest warez {
        domainlist      warez/domains
        urllist         warez/urls
}

       Now your acl looks like that:

acl {
        default {
                pass    !adv !porn !warez all
                redirect http://localhost/block.html
                }
}

    3. Whitelisting
       Sometimes there is a demand to allow specific URLs and domains
       although they are part of the blocklists for a good reason. In this
       case you want to whitelist these domains and URLs.

       Defining a whitelist
dest white {
        domainlist      white/domains
        urllist         white/urls
}

acl {
        default {
                pass    white !adv !porn !warez all
                redirect http://localhost/block.html
                }
}

       In this example we assumed that your whitelists are located in a
       directory called white whithin the blacklist directory you
       specified with dbhome.
       Make sure that your white identifier is the first in the row of the
       pass directive. It must not have an exclamation mark in front
       (otherwise all entries belonging to white will be blocked, too).
    4. Initializing the blacklists
       Before you start up your squidGuard you should initialize the
       blacklists i.e. convert them from the textfiles to db files. Using
       the db format will speed up the checking and blocking.
       The initialization is performed by the following command:

   Initializing the blacklists
squidGuard -C all

       Depending on the size of your blacklists and the power of your
       computer this may take a while. If anything is running fine you
       should see something like the following output:

2006-01-29 12:16:14 [31977] squidGuard 1.2.0p2 started (1138533256.959)
2006-01-29 12:16:14 [31977] db update done
2006-01-29 12:16:14 [31977] squidGuard stopped (1138533374.571)

       If you look into the directories holding the files domains and urls
       you see that additional files have been created: domains.db and
       urls.db. These new files must not be empty!
       Only those files are converted you specified to block or whitelist
       in your squidGuard.conf file.
