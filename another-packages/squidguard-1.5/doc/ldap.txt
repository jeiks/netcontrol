  squidGuard - Tips for using LDAP

   Some user experienced problem running squidGuard with LDAP
   authentication. In most cases on startup squidGuard gave a syntax or
   parsing error when the ldapsearch line was read in. This can be result
   of several shortcomings. The list below is compiled from own
   experiences and user feedback. Hopefully it assists you to successfully
   set up LDAP authentication with squidGuard.
   Please check your installation for the following topics:
    1. flex and bison
       Make sure that you have flex and bison installed.
       You can compile squidguard without but then LDAP will not work. If
       the squidGuard process encounters the lack of flex and/or bison it
       takes previously generated files to include them into the code.
       These flex and bison files have been created without any additional
       options (to ensure that they can run on most systems).
    2. Using RPMs
       Not all available RPMs do have the LDAP functionality compiled in.
       If no LDAP libraries (or LDAP itself) is on the list or
       requirements there is a good chance that the package builds without
       it. You may wish to check with the vendor of the RPM.
       if you are building squidGuard from the sources check the next
       topics.
    3. ldap libraries
       In order to use LDAP functionalities the system must have the
       proper LDAP libraries and include files installed (openldap works
       fine).
    4. configure with ldap
       Before you compile squidGuard you must run configure with the ldap
       option activated:

   Running configure with ldap option:
  ./configure --with-ldap=yes

    5. name resolution
       Make sure that the system squidGuard is running on can properly
       resolve its own name.
       It has been reported that a syntax error shows up if the system
       cannot resolve its own name properly.
    6. AD forrest: answering with referals
       Currently squidGuard is not able to handle referals as answer from
       an Active Directory. If you don't need referals in your environment
       you can turn them off. Otherwise you have to specify a fixed server
       and path where the user information can be obtained. Please take a
       look on the [8]"What to do with Active Directory Referals?" page
       how users solved this problem in their environment.
    7. configuration errors
       Make sure that there are no typos your configuration. The correct
       host is addressed to lookup the correct group membership with the
       correct password in the correct LDAP tree.
