		  squidGuard 1.2.0 has been released
		  ==================================

Tele Danmark Internordia is proud to announce the release of
squidGuard vesion 1.2.0

			     Introduction
			     ============

squidGuard is a combined filter, redirector and
   access controller plugin for Squid. It is
     * free
     * very flexible
     * extremely fast *)
     * easily installed
     * portable
       
    squidGuard can be used to
     * limit the web access for some users to a list of accepted/well
       known web servers and/or URLs only.
     * block access to some listed or blacklisted web servers and/or URLs
       for some users. **)
     * block access to URLs matching a list of regular expressions or
       words for some users. **)
     * enforce the use of domainnames/prohibit the use of IP address in
       URLs. **)
     * redirect blocked URLs to an "intelligent" CGI based info page. **)
     * redirect unregistered user to a registration form.
     * redirect popular downloads like Netscape, MSIE etc. to local
       copies.
     * redirect banners to an empty GIF. **)
     * have different access rules based on time of day, day of the week,
       date etc.
     * have different rules for different user groups.
     * and much more..
       
    Neither squidGuard nor Squid can be used to
     * filter/censor/edit text inside documents
     * filter/censor/edit embeded scripting languages like JavaScript or
       VBscript inside HTML
       
   *) 100,000 requests in 10seconds on a 500MHz Pentium with lists of
            5900 domains
            7880 urls
          13780 total
          
       100,000 requests in 12seconds on a 500MHz Pentium with lists of
              5900 domains
          200000 urls
          205900 total
          
       I.e. domain and URL listsizes have neglectable performance effect
          
          
   **) squidGuard is not a porn or banner filter/blocker, but it is very
          well suited for these purposes too.
          
			     Capabilities
			     ============

   squidGuard has many powerful configuration options that lets you:
    1. define different time spaces based on any reasonable
       combination of
          + time of day (00:00-08:00 17:00-24:00)
          + day of the week (sa)
          + date (1999-05-13)
          + date range (1999-04-01-1999-04-05)
          + date wildcards (*-01-01 *-05-17 *-12-25)
    2. group sources (users/clients) into distinct categories like
       "managers", "employees", "teachers", "students", "customers",
       "guests" etc. based on any reasonable combination of
          + IP address ranges with
          + prefix notation (172.16.0.0/12)
          + netmask notation (172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0)
          + first-last notation (172.16.0.11-172.16.0.35)
    3. address lists (172.16.134.54 172.16.156.23 ...)
    4. domain lists (foo.bar.com ...) *)
    5. user id lists (weho sdgh dfhj asef ...) **) and optionally
       link the group to a given time space
          + positively (within business-hours)
          + negatively (outside leisure-time)
    6. group destinations (URLs/servers) into distinct categories
       like "local", "customers", "vendors", "banners", "banned" etc.
       based on an unlimited number of unlimited lists of
          + domains, including subdomains (foo.bar.com)
          + hosts (host.foo.bar.com)
          + directory URLs, including subdirectories
            (foo.bar.com/some/dir)
          + file URLs (foo.bar.com/somewhere/file.html)
          + regular expressions ((expr1|expr2|...))
       and optionally link the group to a given time space:
          + positively (within business-hours)
          + negatively (outside leisure-time)
    7. rewrite/redirect URLs based on any reasonable combination of
          + string/regular expression editing à la sed with
          + silent squid redirecting rewrite (s@from@to@)
          + visible client redirecting rewrite (s@from@to@r) ***)
          + URL replacement with
          + silent squid redirect to a common URL (redirect "new_url")
          + visible client redirect to a common URL
            (redirect "302:new_url") ***)
       activated by
          + 1-1 URL redirection
          + destination group match
          + a fallback/default for blocked URLs
          + a fallback/default for blocked/unknown clients
       and optionally with
          + runtime string substitution à la strftime or printf
    8. define access control lists (acl) based on any reasonable
       combination of the definitions above by
          + giving each source (user/client) group
          + a pass list with any reasonable combination of
          + acceptable destination groups (good-dests ...)
          + unacceptable destination groups (!bad-dests ...)
          + block IP address URLs (enforce the use of domain names)
            (!in-addr)
          + wildcards/nothing (any|all|none)
    9. optionally a common rewrite rule set for the source group
   10. optionally a default replacement URL for blocked destinations
       for the source group
       
        and optionally:
                
   11. link the acl to a given time space
          + positively (within business-hours)
          + negatively (outside leisure-time)
   12. defining a fallback/default ruleset
   13. have selective logging by optional log statements in the: ****)
          + source/client group declarations to log all translations
            for the group (log "file")
          + destination group declarations. Typically used to log
            blacklist matches. (log "file")
          + rewrite rule group declarations to log all translations
            for the rule set (log "file")
       and optionally anonymized to protect the individuals
       (log anonymous "file")
       
   *) Client access control based on domain name requires enabling
   reverse lookups (log_fqdn on) in squid.conf.
   **) Client access control based on user id requires enabling
   RFC931/ident in squid.conf. Note: The RFC931/ident configuration is
   changed in squid-2.2 and the RFC931/ident support is broken in
   squid-2.2 at least up to STABLE2. We currently recommend using
   squid-2.1.PATCH2 in production if RFC931 is used.
   ***) Note: Visible redirects (302:new-url) are not supported by some
   interim versions of Squid (presumably 1.2-2.0).
   ****) Note: squidGuard is smart enough to open only one filedescriptor
   per logfile (i.e. not necessarily one per log statement); per spawned
   process of course. Though logging to too many different files may
   exeed your system's concurrent filedescriptor limit. 
   
			     Portability
			     ===========

   squidGuard should compile right out of the box on any modern brand of
   UNIX with a development environment and a recent version (2.7.X or
   3.2.X) of the Berkeley DB library. squidGuard is developed on Sun
   Solaris-2.8 with gcc-2.95.3, bison-1.28, flex-2.5.4.
   We also test regularly on Linux/RedHat with gcc and
   our most recent copy of the Berkeley DB.
   
   Users have reported success on at least, but not limited to:
     * AIX: 4.1.3, 4.3.2.0/egcs-2.91.66
     * Dec-Unix: OSF1-4.0/gcc-2.7.2.3, 3.2C/gcc-2.7.2.3
     * Linux: RedHat-5.2/gcc-2.8.1 and later
     * Solaris: 2.6/gcc-2.7.2.3
     * Solaris: 2.8/gcc-2.95.3


			      Nota Bene!
			      ==========
   .db files created with Berkeley DB version 2.7.X are NOT
   compatible with Berkeley DB version 3.2.X! If you created files
   with "squidGuard-1.1.X -C" you must export them to a plain text
   file and remove all .db files and run "squidGuard-1.2.0 -C"

		       News in squidGuard-1.2.0
		       ========================
   o Support for Berkeley DB version 3.2.X.
   o Support for userquotas.
   o All known bugs are fixed.
   See the CHANGELOG for details.
