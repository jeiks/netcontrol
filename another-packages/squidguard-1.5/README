			      What it is
			      ~~~~~~~~~~

squidGuard is a free (GPL), flexible and ultra fast filter, redirector
and access controller plugin for squid.  It lets you define multiple
access rules with different restrictions for different user groups on
a squid cache.  squidGuard uses squid's standard redirector interface.

The initial squidGuard concept was designed by Pål Baltzersen and was
implemented and was maintained and extended by Lars Erik Håland at

Since December 2006 squidGuard is maintained by Shalla Secure Services.
